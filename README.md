- Lightweight, stylized LLM agents built using GPT-2: [GPT-2 personas](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/tree/main/gpt2);
- Character-driven agents implemented in open-source Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF: [Mistral AI personas](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/tree/main/mistral);
- Personas that violate Grice's Conversational Maxims: [an experiment](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/tree/main/personas/grice-s-maxims);
- Explore my [Insights Collection](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/patriciaschaffer/blob/main/insights/README.md) for essays on AI ethics, human-AI relationships and trust;
- Applied Research: [Bias in AI Responses: A Prompt-Based Analysis of Tone, Ideology, and Temperature in Large Language Models](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/about_me/tree/main/research);
- Simulating a Small Language Model: [The "Little Ocean" project](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/about_me/tree/main/python-projects);
- Models to interact with locally using [Gradio](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/blob/main/mistral/gradio/README.md).
- **Working on RAG systems to [simulate memory](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/tree/main/memory-rag/README.md) in local models/personas.**

### About Me

I’m an early adopter of computers and the internet, always curious about the intersections of technology and human behavior. My journey spans education, psychology, and cutting-edge AI—especially Large Language Models (LLMs). I believe that understanding natural languages is key to building technology that truly serves people. I'm here because LLMs need more than computer science, and we should all join the conversation and build together. This GitHub is my portfolio: an open notebook of prototypes, research, and teaching resources that explore how we can shape more thoughtful, responsive AI systems.

> **Motto:**  
> _"We've made mistakes with the internet. Let's do better with AI."_

### My Approach

At first, I deliberately worked with models designed for the end user, since most people will experience AI through practical, designed interfaces, not theoretical intelligence. This is the true entry point for trust, adoption, and real-world impact, and it’s also where future clients and collaborations will emerge. My work shapes these agents for consistency, alignment, and tangible value in the hands of those who use them.

Recently, however, I've started playing with open source GPT-2 and [Mistral AI](https://github.com/mistralai), locally hosting personas that may be useful for language practice, companionship, wellbeing etc. Now, I am testing RAG to simulate memory in some of those personas.
