### Personal Projects

- **I haven't had time to update the new projects I'm currently working on :-( Sorry; feel free to reach out.** They're about consistency x accuracy, attention mechanisms-the space to reply between human and machine, always tied to language and psychology. Sorry; I haven't updated models, personas, setups.
👩‍🎨 See the [Agent Architect](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/blob/main/README.md) repo for AI persona and model design: consistency, tone, and conversational alignment (or go straight to [LLM Society Overview](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/blob/main/llm-society.md#llm-society-overview) for visuals);
🧠 RAG systems to [simulate memory](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/tree/main/memory-rag/README.md) in local models/personas;
🤖 Lightweight, stylized LLM agents built using GPT-2: [GPT-2 personas](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/tree/main/gpt2);
🎭 Character-driven agents implemented in open-source Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF: [Mistral AI personas](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/tree/main/mistral);
😈 Personas that violate Grice's Conversational Maxims: [an experiment](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/tree/main/personas/grice-s-maxims);
👶 Simulating a Small Language Model: [The "Little Ocean" project](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/blob/fba3340a20da751aa26da536d2c05d1229eaad20/python-projects/README.md);
🖥️ Models to interact with locally using [Gradio](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/blob/main/mistral/gradio/README.md) => P.S. I no longer use Gradio #askmewhy;
🤔 Explore my [Insights Collection](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/blob/main/insights/README.md) for essays on AI ethics, human-AI relationships and trust;
🙇‍♀️ [Applied Research](https://github.com/patriciaschaffer/agent-architect/blob/fba3340a20da751aa26da536d2c05d1229eaad20/research/README.md): 1. Ocean & Breeze: Persona Stability and Meta-Awareness in LLMs / 2. Bias in AI Responses: A Prompt-Based Analysis of Tone, Ideology, and Temperature in Large Language Models. / 3.

### About Me

I’m an early adopter of computers and the internet, always curious about the intersections of technology and human behavior. My journey spans education, psychology, and cutting-edge AI—especially Large Language Models (LLMs). I believe that understanding natural languages is key to building technology that truly serves people. I'm here because LLMs need more than computer science, and we should all join the conversation and build together. This GitHub is my portfolio: an open notebook of prototypes, research, and teaching resources that explore how we can shape more thoughtful, responsive AI systems.

> **Motto:**  
> _"We've made mistakes with the internet. Let's do better with AI."_

→ I design and study AI-powered tools to help users to understand themselves better and make informed decisions. I’m woking on behavioral modeling and conversation design, two fields that intersect to create systems that feel human-centric, ethical, and empowering. I have personal projects that combine predictive models and conversational AI to design tools that support personal growth and mental health (for example, a self-reflection tool that uses a conversational AI interface to guide users through personalized emotional check-ins, mood tracking, and behavioral insights—only providing feedback when requested). **I believe in a privacy-first, user autonomy approach, ensuring that users remain in control of their data and experiences while also benefiting from the insights AI can offer.**

### My Approach

At first, I deliberately worked with models designed for the end user, since most people will experience AI through practical, designed interfaces, not theoretical intelligence. This is the true entry point for trust, adoption, and real-world impact, and it’s also where future clients and collaborations will emerge. My work shapes these agents for consistency, alignment, and tangible value in the hands of those who use them.

Recently, however, I've started playing with open source GPT-2 and [Mistral AI](https://github.com/mistralai), locally hosting personas that may be useful for language practice, companionship, wellbeing etc. Now, I am testing RAG to simulate memory in some of those personas.


**Interested in collaborating with teams working at the intersection of LLMs, philosophy of language/mind, human-centered design, AI literacy and ethical AI.**
